# Social Network API

### This is an API that could be used on a social network that supports creating a user, creating thoughts posted by the user, the ability to add reactions to thoughts, the ability to add friends to a user, and of course the ability to delete all of these by their ID.

### Created with JavaScript, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.
